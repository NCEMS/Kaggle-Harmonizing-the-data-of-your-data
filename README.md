## About the Competition

### Problem Statement

Scientific knowledge is disseminated through research articles where experimental metadata, sample types, conditions, and analytical methods are described in natural language. The **Sample Data Relationship Format (SDRF)** is a standardized, machine-readable format that describes these experimental details.

**Challenge**: Most published studies lack complete or consistent SDRF annotations, preventing large-scale data integration and AI-driven discovery.

**Your Goal**: Build a solution that can read scientific papers and automatically extract and structure experimental information into valid SDRF metadata. Your pipeline can use any approach: rule-based systems, LLM prompting, classical NLP, or fine-tuned models.

### Use Case: Proteomics

Proteomics is the comprehensive study of proteins—their structures, functions, and interactions. Understanding proteins is essential for:
- Advancing medicine and biotechnology
- Understanding disease mechanisms
- Accelerating experimental research

A successful solution will revolutionize our ability to perform large-scale comparative analyses of scientific data by removing the barrier to accessing structured experimental metadata.

## Evaluation Metric

Submissions are scored using a **macro-averaged F1 score** comparing your predicted SDRF to the gold standard across all SDRF fields.

### Scoring Details

The evaluation uses:
- **Primary Metric**: Macro-averaged F1 score per SDRF field
- **Clustering**: Text values are clustered using string similarity (difflib) with agglomerative clustering
- **Ranking**: Leaderboard ranks by macro-F1 on the held-out test set
- **Validation**: Submissions failing schema or validation checks receive a score of 0.00

## Using the Scoring Function

This repository includes the expanded scoring function used in the Kaggle leaderboard. Use it locally to evaluate your submissions before uploading to Kaggle.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/Kaggle-Harmonizing-the-data-of-your-data.git
cd Kaggle-Harmonizing-the-data-of-your-data

# Install dependencies
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

### Quick Start

The scoring function is located in [src/Scoring.py](src/Scoring.py).

#### Command Line Usage

```bash
python src/Scoring.py \
  --solution path/to/solution.csv \
  --submission path/to/submission.csv \
  --output detailed_metrics.csv
```

**Arguments:**
- `--solution`: Path to the gold-standard SDRF CSV file
- `--submission`: Path to your predicted SDRF CSV file
- `--output`: (Optional) Path to save detailed evaluation metrics (default: `detailed_evaluation_metrics.csv`)

**Output:**
- Prints the detailed evaluation metrics dataframe
- Prints the final SDRF Average F1 Score
- Saves detailed metrics to CSV file

#### Python API Usage

```python
import pandas as pd
from src.Scoring import score

# Load your dataframes
solution_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/solution.csv')
submission_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/submission.csv')

# Compute score
eval_df, final_score = score(solution_df, submission_df, row_id_column_name='ID')

print(f"Final Score: {final_score:.6f}")
print(eval_df)
```

### Key Functions

#### `score(solution, submission, row_id_column_name)`

Main scoring function that compares a submission against the gold standard.

**Parameters:**
- `solution` (pd.DataFrame): Gold-standard SDRF dataframe
- `submission` (pd.DataFrame): Predicted SDRF dataframe
- `row_id_column_name` (str): Name of the row ID column (will be dropped before scoring)

**Returns:**
- Tuple of `(eval_df, final_score)` where:
  - `eval_df`: Detailed metrics per PXD and annotation type
  - `final_score`: Single float in [0, 1]

#### `Harmonize_and_Evaluate_datasets(A, B, threshold=0.80)`

Harmonizes two SDRF datasets by clustering similar text values and computing precision, recall, F1, and Jaccard scores.

**Parameters:**
- `A`, `B` (Dict): SDRF data as nested dictionaries (keyed by PXD then column)
- `threshold` (float): Similarity threshold for clustering (default: 0.80)

**Returns:**
- `(harmonized_A, harmonized_B, eval_df)`: Cluster-mapped data and evaluation metrics

### CSV Format Requirements

Your submission must follow the **SampleSubmission.csv** format exactly. Each row represents a data file with its associated experimental metadata.

**Required Columns:**
- **`ID`**: Unique identifier for each row (will be dropped during scoring)
- **`PXD`**: Publication identifier (e.g., "PXD004010")
- **`Raw Data File`**: Associated raw data file name
- **`Characteristics[*]`**: SDRF characteristic annotations (organism, disease, cell type, etc.)
- **`Comment[*]`**: Technical metadata comments (instrument, MS analyzer, fragmentation method, etc.)
- **`FactorValue[*]`**: Experimental factor values (treatment, temperature, etc.)
- **`Usage`**: Specifies how the sample/file is used

**Key Notes:**
- Fill cells with the extracted metadata values or leave blank if unknown
- All rows must be aligned with the same column structure as SampleSubmission.csv
- "Text Span" in the template indicates where you should fill in actual values
- The scoring function uses the `PXD`, `ID`, and all metadata columns for comparison

**Example:**
```csv
ID,PXD,Raw Data File,Characteristics[Organism],Characteristics[Disease],FactorValue[Treatment],Usage
1,PXD004010,ad_pl01.raw,Homo sapiens,cancer,control,Raw Data File
2,PXD004010,ad_pl02.raw,Homo sapiens,cancer,treated,Raw Data File
```

Refer to [data/SampleSubmission.csv](data/SampleSubmission.csv) for the complete column structure with all required fields.

## How to Submit
